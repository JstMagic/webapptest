
1. Doesn't compile out of the gate: PhoneBookImpl doesn't have right signatures.

2. Putting main in PhoneBookImpl seems like a really bad idea.
   I would separate it out.  Unless testing exactly THAT is part of the point.
   
3. I really hate the TODO's in main.   There's a lot of interpretation going on
   about what you want.  That may discriminate unfairly against someone with
   weaker english language skills.
   
4. Why is there a List of people, at all?  Seems to serve no useful purpose.

5. DatabaseUtil: This class is just a utility class, you should not have to change anything here
   Bullshit!   It's the 2nd class I needed to change, to abstract some of the database access.
   
6. I hate some parts of my solution... where exactly the Connection object should live is 
   unclear, and my quick hack is a bit of a mess about that.  With more time I would put it 
   in one and only one place.
